### ðŸŒŸ Features and How It Works

1. **Add Items to Cache**  
   Enter a key and value, then click `Add to Cache` to store the data in the LRU Cache.

2. **Retrieve Items**  
   Input a key and click `Get from Cache` to fetch a value. A success message or a `Cache miss` will be displayed.

3. **Automatic Removal**  
   Observe the least recently used items being removed (with smooth animations!) when the cache reaches its capacity.

4. **Deleted Items History**  
   All removed items are logged in a history table, including their key, value, and timestamp of removal.
